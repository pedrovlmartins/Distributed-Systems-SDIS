# Distributed systems

Two projects made for a Distributed Systems subject, whose goals are:

* understand the fundamental concepts and the challenges associated to distributed applications
* apply well known techniques to the design and implementation of simple distributed applications
* analyze simple distributed solutions and evaluate their fitness to the problems they aim to solve.

First project developed by me and [Pedro Fraga](https://github.com/pedrofraga).

Second project developed by me, [InÃªs Santos](https://github.com/IneSantos), [Francisco Rodrigues](https://github.com/francisco-rodrigues) and [Pedro Fraga](https://github.com/pedrofraga).
